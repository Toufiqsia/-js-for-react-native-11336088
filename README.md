# Array Manipulation Project

**Student ID:** [1336088]

## Project Overview

This project consists of three main tasks aimed at demonstrating array manipulation and formatting in JavaScript. The tasks are divided into two JavaScript files: `arrayManipulation.js` and `userInfo.js`.

### Task 1: processArray Function

**File:** `arrayManipulation.js`

The `processArray` function processes an array of numbers. It takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array where:
- Each even number is squared.
- Each odd number is tripled.

**Example:**
```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const processedNumbers = processArray(numbers);
console.log(processedNumbers); // Output: [3, 4, 9, 16, 15]
